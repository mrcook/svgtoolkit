// Package svgtoolkit provides a toolkit for creating SVG documents.
//
// In this library you can find some basic SVG document building functions,
// as well as a pattern generator, which is a port of the RUby GEM `geo_pattern` by Jason Long.
//
// It is possible to generate patterns from the command line. See the `cmd` directory for more information.
